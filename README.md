First, you need to have narwhal installed. You can check that it is installed by doing the following:

    js --version
    
After that, you can just do

    sudo tusk install http://github.com/280north/OJTest/master/zipball
    
And the libraries will be installed. OJAutotest has some other external dependencies that you need to install separately. You can find [installing instructions on the wiki](http://wiki.github.com/280north/OJTest/ojautotest).
